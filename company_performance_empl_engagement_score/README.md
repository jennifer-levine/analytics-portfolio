## Data

| Dataset      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|

| `employees` | Employee-level engagement metrics including campaign response rate, tenure, and event attendance |

---

## Approach

2. Aggregated employee engagement metrics at the company level  
3. Created a **composite engagement score**  
4. Ranked companies by **revenue** and **engagement**

## Key Insights

| Insight | Explanation |
|---------|------------|
| Engagement Is Not Linearly Related to Revenue | High engagement is seen across all revenue tiers, not just top earners |
| Campaign Response Rate Is the Primary Engagement Driver | Employee responses to campaigns have the strongest correlation with overall engagement |
| High-Engagement, Mid-Revenue Companies Are Prime Growth Targets | These companies offer high engagement potential without top-tier revenue |

## Executive Summary
Analysis of active companies shows that engagement varies widely across revenue tiers. Several low- and mid-revenue companies exhibit exceptionally high engagement scores. **Campaign response rate** is the dominant driver of engagement, while **event attendance** acts as a secondary feature.  

These patterns suggest opportunities to re-prioritize focus beyond revenue alone, identifying companies with high engagement potential for strategic initiatives.
