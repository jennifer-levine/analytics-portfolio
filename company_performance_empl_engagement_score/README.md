# Analysis of Company Performance by Revenue and Employee Engagement

## Business Question
Which companies have the highest sales revenue and the most engaged employees (e.g., high campaign response rate, high event attendance)?

## Data
- **`companies`**: Company-level attributes including industry, revenue, contract status, and region  
- **`employees`**: Employee-level engagement metrics including campaign response rate, tenure, and event attendance

## Approach
1. Filtered to active contracts and active employees  
2. Aggregated employee engagement metrics at the company level  
3. Created a composite engagement score  
4. Ranked companies by revenue and engagement

## Key Insights
- **Engagement Is Not Linearly Related to Revenue**  
- **Campaign Response Rate Is the Primary Engagement Driver**  
- **High-Engagement, Mid-Revenue Companies Are Prime Growth Targets**

## Executive Summary
Analysis of active companies reveals that engagement varies widely across revenue tiers, with several low- and mid-revenue companies exhibiting exceptionally high engagement scores. Campaign response rate is the dominant driver of engagement, while event attendance acts as a secondary feature. These patterns suggest opportunities to re-prioritize focus beyond revenue alone.
